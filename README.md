# CryptoClustering
Module19

Unsupervised learning was used to predict the affects of price chances on cryptocurrency. Standard Scaler from scikit-learn was used to normalize the data. The elbow method was used to find the best value for k. The Crypotcurrrencies were then clustered with the K-means model. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to optimize the clusters. Using the PCA data, the best value for k was found. Finally, the Crypotcurrrencies were then clustered with the K-means using the PCA data.
